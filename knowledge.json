Section 2(a)(10) of the 1933 Act defines prospectus to include any “circular, advertisement, letter or communication . . . which offers any security for sale.” Section 5 of the 1933 Act prohibits a person from distributing a prospectus for any security unless it complies with strict disclosure requirements imposed by Section 10 of the 1933 Act. Section 10(a) dictates the content of the statutory prospectus and Section 10(b) permits a “summary prospectus” and an “omitting prospectus.” With a few exceptions, mutual fund marketing materials generally fall within the definition of a prospectus and thereby are subject to these disclosure requirements. However, SEC regulations offer several means of creating marketing materials which can be used directly."
